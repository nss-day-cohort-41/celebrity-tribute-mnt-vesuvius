# Nashville Software School Tribute Agency Webpage

## Description

Our task was to compile a tribute report on an artist we are considering inducting into our fictional Nashville Software School Tribute Agency (NSSTA). We were to create the following pages: Executive Summary, Personal, Career, and News Feed. We used semantic HTML and CSS to create these pages, as well as using BEM class declarations, flexbox, and embedding links for audio files and Google Maps. 

## Installation

1. To run our code, please run a git pull to your internet web directory and launch index.html on your browser. 
2. Every HTML page was run through HTML validator at [https://validator.w3.org/] and passed.

## Usage

1. Click on each individual page on Navigation bar (top of page) for their content
2. Click on embedded Spotify audio on Home page to listen to Prince and some of his collaborators
3. Click on the embedded Google Maps on Home page to see where Prince's Paisley Home is located and how to find directions to it from anywhere
4. Click on images in News Feed to open links to current events and news about Prince
5. Click on social media links in footer to access Prince's pages.

## Project Status
This project is considered complete.
